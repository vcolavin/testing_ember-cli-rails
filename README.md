# Hey
This is me trying to make [ember-cli-rails](https://github.com/rwz/ember-cli-rails) work from a couple different directories.

It is tremendously uninteresting.

Here are some steps!

1. Bundle
2. Navigate to ember_app_in_root/
3. run:
    npm install && bower install
4. Navigate to app/ember_app_in_app/
5. run:
    npm install && bower install
6. return to the app root
7. run yer server
